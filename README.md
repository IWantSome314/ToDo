A To Do list on things to do and Projects

## To-Do List App with Advanced Features
Why? The To-Do List app is often a developerâ€™s first interactive project, and with good reason. It teaches core JavaScript, user input handling, and DOM manipulation. But to make it stand out, add advanced features that show off your skills.

### Features to include:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or in progress
- Filter tasks by status (completed, in progress)
- Save the list in local storage so users can revisit it later
- Skills Covered: JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event handling), local storage to persist data, CSS for styling and layout. You can also practice modularizing code by breaking down functions.
- Pro Tip: Use CSS transitions for smooth task animations, such as fading tasks in and out when added or deleted.
